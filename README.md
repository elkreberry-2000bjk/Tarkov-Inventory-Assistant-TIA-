Your smart loot companion for Escape from Tarkov.

Make the best decisions under raid pressure. This tool analyzes items in real-time and gives you contextual hints to fill your backpack with maximum profit.

🚀 Why You Need This
Maximize Profit: Get instant value-per-slot data based on live market prices. Always pick the most valuable loot.

Save Time: Stop alt-tabbing to check prices or memorizing hundreds of items. Stay focused in the raid.

Learn Faster: The perfect tool for beginners to understand loot value and grasp Tarkov's economy.

Clean Gameplay: This tool does NOT interact with the game client, memory, or network traffic. It uses visual analysis only (computer vision).

⚙️ How It Works (Simple & Safe)
Screen Capture: The app passively reads an area of your screen (your inventory).

Smart Recognition: It identifies items using image recognition.

Data Check: Compares found items against a regularly updated price database.

Clear Overlay: Shows a clean, non-intrusive overlay with color-coded hints (Green = high priority, Red = low value) right on your game screen.

🔧 Installation (Easy 3-Step Setup)
Download the latest release.

Extract the archive to any folder.

⚠️ Crucial Legal & Safety Notes
This is NOT a cheat. It provides only information that is already visible on your screen. It does not give unfair advantages like player positions, aim assistance, or item spawning.

Compliance-First Approach: The tool works like a passive assistant, analyzing a video feed. It does not modify game files, inject code, or read game memory. However, as with any third-party tool, use at your own discretion.

Transparency & Open Source: The code is open for community review and contribution.

Fair Use: We help you process information faster. The final decision is always yours.

📁 Price Database & Updates
The app includes a built-in item database. It can optionally update price data from community-driven sources to stay accurate. You control the update frequency.
